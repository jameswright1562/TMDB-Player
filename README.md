### 1. Quick Access to TMDB Website  
- The extension popup includes a button to quickly open the TMDB website for easy navigation.

### 6. Edge: Install TMDB as an App  
- On Microsoft Edge, you can install TMDB as a standalone app for a more immersive experience. Here’s how:  
  1. Go to the [TMDB website](https://www.themoviedb.org/).  
  2. Click on the three dots (settings) in the top-right corner.  
  3. Select **Apps** and then click **Install The Movie Database**.
